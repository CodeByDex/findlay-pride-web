                    <div className='question'>I thought LGBTQ+ Spectrum of Findlay (Spectrum) and/or Kaleidoscope Youth Center (KYC) planned Pride in Findlay? </div>
                    <div className='response'>Spectrum (and now/soon to be KYC) has historically led the effort for Pride events in Findlay, and they are still planning some events with a small selection of Findlay businesses in June. We welcome you to work with them, especially if you are interested in doing any kind of charitable fundraising.  We plan to highlight the work Spectrum is doing, and we additionally want to help show appreciation for every business that is creating an engaging and welcoming environment for Findlay citizens in June.</div>

                    <div className='question'>Whatâ€™s the catch?</div>
                    <div className='response'>No catch! We want to support businesses that support the community - simple as that! We are not fundraising or requesting funds to accomplish our goals; this is a 100% volunteer and grassroots effort.</div>
