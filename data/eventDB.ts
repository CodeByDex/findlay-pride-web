        description: `Feels Like an Eternity examines the relationship between eternity and queer utopia, two imagined spaces built around longing and always just out of reach. By reimagining religious stories and symbols and layering them with imagery sourced from gay porn magazines, I aim to reclaim eternity as a radical space where sex and connection become the gateway to our salvation. In this way, queer eternity feels closest in those fleeting moments where desire and touch are fully realized and longing is fulfilled. Thus, our connections are no longer something that separates us from the sacred but rather brings us closer to it.`,
